% This function fourierShapeDescriptor calculates fourier shape descriptors
% of simple binary region boundary according to the method described by Rafael C. 
% Gonzalez, Richard E. Woods "Digital Image Processing" 3rd ed. Chapter 11 (p840)
%
% B = fourierShapeDescriptor(A,r)
%
% inputs,
%   A : The binary image containing the region of interest. This program
%       was tested for single connected component (CC) only. Multiple CCs will
%       cause only one CC to be described.
%   r : Ratio of boundary pixel to fourier coefficients. Large ratio means
%       the shape would be described by less fourier coeffiecient. r = 1
%       means will yield the unapproximated region boundary in A.
%       Typically, r could be less than 100 without sacrificing boundary
%       quality.
%
% outputs,
%   B: Output binary image reconstructed by the number of fourier
%   coefficients specified by the user.
